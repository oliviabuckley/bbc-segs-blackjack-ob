      <h2>How to Play</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to Blackjack! The goal of the game is to get as close as
        possible to 21 without going over.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will be dealt two cards when the game starts. If the sum of these
        cards is 21, you have Blackjack and have won the game. If you don't have
        Blackjack, you need to decide if you want to draw another card (hit), or
        stick with the hand you have (stand).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Player's turn:</strong> Click "Hit" to draw another card, or
        "Stand" to end your turn.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dealer's turn:</strong> The dealer will play automatically after
        the player stands. The dealer must draw cards until they reach 17 or
        higher.
      </p>
      <p>
        If either the player or dealer goes over 21, they bust and lose the
        game. If both have the same hand value, it's a tie!
